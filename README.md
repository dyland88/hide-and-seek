```

## Running the mobile app, server, and docs

1. Install the package manager, yarn (must be version 1)

```
npm install -g yarn@1
```

1. Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

2. Start the program

```
yarn run dev
```

You can also run each package separately with the following commands:

- To run the docs project:
  ```
  yarn run dev:docs
  ```

- To run the mobile app:
  ```
  yarn run dev:mobile
  ```

- To run the supabase server:
  ```
  yarn run dev:supabase
  ```

## Adding to the documentation

Edit Markdown files in the `pages/` directory. Your changes will be
live-reloaded by Nextra.

## Code Formatting & Linting

Each project adheres to consistent code style. Each time before you push
changes, run the following commands:

### Prettier

- Prettier will automatically format your code so our project has consistent
  formatting and line spacing

- To format your code using Prettier in the project, run the following commands
  in the root project directory:

  ```
  npx prettier --write .
  ```

### Linting

- The linter ensures that your code does not have any errors.
- To run the linter for the mobile app or docs project, use:

  ```
  yarn run lint
  ```

Happy coding and thanks for contributing!
