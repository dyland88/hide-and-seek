   npm install
   ```

## Running and Contributing to the Docs

Our docs are built with Next.js & Nextra. To contribute:

1. Navigate to the `docs/` directory:

   ```
   cd docs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Edit Markdown files in the `pages/` directory. Your changes will be
   live-reloaded by Nextra.

## Code Formatting & Linting

Each project adheres to consistent code style:

### Prettier

- To format your code using Prettier in any project, run:

  ```
  npx prettier --write .
  ```

### Linting

- To run the linter for the mobile app or docs project, use:

  ```
  npm run lint
  ```

  (Ensure you are in the respective project folder, or adjust the command if
  running from the root.)

Happy coding and thanks for contributing!
