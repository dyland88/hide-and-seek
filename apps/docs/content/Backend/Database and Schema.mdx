title: Database and Schema
description: Understanding how Drizzle ORM, Zod, and Supabase work together to manage your database schema.
---

This document explains how we use Drizzle ORM, Zod, and Supabase to manage the database schema in this project. It covers the key concepts, setup, and common tasks like pushing schema changes and running migrations.

## Core Technologies

- **Drizzle ORM:** A TypeScript ORM that allows you to define your database schema in code and interact with your database in a type-safe way.
- **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. We use Zod to define the shape of our data and validate it at runtime.
- **Supabase:** A backend-as-a-service platform that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and other features.

## How They Work Together

1.  **Schema Definition:** We define our database schema using Drizzle ORM in the `@repo/schema` package. This includes defining tables, columns, and relationships. We also define Zod schemas that mirror the Drizzle schemas. This allows us to validate data both on the client and server side.

2.  **Data Validation:** Zod schemas are used to validate data before it is inserted into the database. This helps to ensure data quality and prevent errors.

3.  **Database Migrations:** Drizzle ORM is used to generate database migrations. These migrations are used to update the database schema when changes are made to the Drizzle schema definitions.

4.  **Supabase Integration:** We use Supabase as our database provider. Drizzle ORM connects to the Supabase database using the connection string stored in the `.env` file.

## Setting Up Your Environment

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed in the `@repo/schema` package. Refer to the `package.json` file for a list of dependencies.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `@repo/schema` directory and set the `SUPABASE_DB_URL` environment variable to your Supabase database connection string. This should be the same value as the `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/supabase/functions/.env`.

## Common Tasks

### Overview

Before diving into the specifics, here's a brief overview of the common database tasks you'll perform:

- **Pushing Schema Changes:** This involves updating your Supabase database to reflect the latest changes in your Drizzle schema definitions.
- Note: In testing cases sometimes its easier to skip migrations. Just delete changed tables and push.

- **Running Migrations:** Applying migration files to your database to update the schema.

For more in-depth information on these tasks and other Drizzle ORM features, refer to the [Drizzle ORM documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/).

### 1. Pushing Schema Changes

To push schema changes to your Supabase database, follow these steps:

1.  **Modify the Drizzle schema:** Make the necessary changes to your Drizzle schema definitions in the `@repo/schema/src/game.ts` file.

2.  **Generate a migration:** Run the following command in the `@repo/schema` directory to generate a new migration file:

    ```bash
    yarn drizzle-kit generate:pg
    ```

    This will create a new migration file in the `@repo/schema/drizzle` directory.

3.  **Apply the migration:** Run the following command in the `@repo/schema` directory to apply the migration to your Supabase database:

    ```bash
    yarn drizzle-
    ```
