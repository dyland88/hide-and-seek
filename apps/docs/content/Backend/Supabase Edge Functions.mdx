---

This document outlines best practices and troubleshooting tips for developing Supabase Edge Functions within this project, using the `create-game-api` function as a primary example.

## Core Concepts

Supabase Edge Functions allow you to deploy server-side logic directly to Supabase's globally distributed network. This offers low latency and scalability for your application's backend processes.

### Key Components

- **`@repo/schema` Package:** This package defines the data structures (schemas) used by both the Edge Functions and the client applications. It ensures type safety and consistency across your project.
- **`deno.json`:** This file manages dependencies and import maps for your Deno environment within the Edge Function.

## Best Practices

When developing Supabase Edge Functions, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Data Validation and Type Safety

- **Input Validation:** Mirroring the `create-game-api` example, create Zod schemas for both input validation and the expected return type of your API calls. This ensures that you're handling data correctly and providing consistent responses.
- **Drizzle ORM:** Define your Drizzle table schemas to closely match your Zod schemas. This promotes consistency between your data models and database structure. Refer to the [Drizzle ORM documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for detailed information on defining table schemas.

### 2. Dependency Management

- **`@repo/schema` Imports:** Import your data schemas from the `@repo/schema` package to maintain consistency across your application.
- **`deno.json` Configuration:** Specify all necessary packages and their versions in the `deno.json` file. This ensures that your Edge Function has access to the required dependencies.

## Testing

### 1. cURL

You can test your Edge Functions using `curl` commands. This is a simple way to send HTTP requests and inspect the responses.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-supabase-url/functions/v1/your-function-name -H "Authorization: Bearer your-supabase-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}'
```

For example, when testing `create-game-api`, run:

```bash
curl -i --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/create-game-api' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer getYourBearerTokenFromSupabaseStart' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"title": "My New Game"}'
```

### 2. Postman

For more advanced testing, you can use Postman to create and manage HTTP requests. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for testing your Edge Functions and inspecting responses.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Environment Variables

Ensure that your environment variables are correctly loaded. You can verify this by logging the value of a variable, such as `DATABASE_URL`:

```javascript
console.log(Deno.env.get("DATABASE_URL"));
```

### 2. Restarting Supabase

If your environment variables are not loaded correctly, you may need to restart Supabase manually. To do this, navigate to the `./apps/supabase/` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn supabase stop
yarn supabase start
```

### Brief outline for how to make edge functions work WITHOUT deploying

You're going to first need ngrok cli: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows

Run through the setup according to the docs in the link above.

1. run the cli first and port forward 54321:

```bash
ngrok http 54321
```

Don't close this! open a new terminal!

copy the link 'forwarding' link, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_URL` to this link,
append `/functions/v1/`

i.e:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_URL=https://79c0-66-231-133-9.ngrok-free.app/functions/v1/

```

and that's it! Your react native app should be able to connect to your functions locally!

Note: While the edge functions are local, the database it queries and writes to is not!

When debugging, check the supabase table editor to see if you get expected behaviors
