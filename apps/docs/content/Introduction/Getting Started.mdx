# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer and have the
[Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) app installed on
your phone.

## Repository Structure

For this project, branches will be split up into three categories: main,
features, and bugfixes

The **main** branch will hold code that has relatively few errors and should always be
a close to working version of the app. This branch will be updated typically for either quick/minor or very important changes.

The **feature** branches will each be created to represent work on one issue.
They should be focused on a specific issue, short-lived, and quickly merged back
into the development branch after work on the issue is completed.
You are allowed to make your own feature branches and work on other's (see more in Contributing).

The **bugfix** branches work very similarly, but are specifically for squashing bugs. (Again, more in Contributing).

## Cloning the Repository

First, navigate to our Github repository and find the green code button near the
top right. Click on it and copy the link that appears in the dropdown.

Next, in your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder/location you would
like your repository to be in.

Then clone your repository and enter the directory it creates:

```bash
$ git clone <paste your repository's address>
$ cd <the newly created directory>
```
