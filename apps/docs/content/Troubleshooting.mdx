# Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you may run into during development :

## Common issues

**The QR code says "no usable data found"**

- This likely means you don't have the Expo Go app installed on your phone.
  Install it and scan the code again.

**npm keeps giving me a `set_execution_policy` error**

- This means Powershell's execution policy does not allow running .ps1 scripts.
  To fix this, open powershell as administrator and run
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
