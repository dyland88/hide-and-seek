# Contributing to OSC-Hide-And-Seek

## 1. Clone the repository

- First, navigate to our Github repository and find the green code button near
  the top right. Click on it and copy the link that appears in the dropdown.

- Next, in your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder/location you
  would like your repository to be in.

- Then clone your repository and enter the directory it creates:

```cmd
$ git clone <paste your repository address>
$ cd <the newly created directory>
```

## 2. Find an issue to work on

<Callout type="info">
Unlike other OSC source projects, we will **not** be assigining issues. Instead,
work on issues will be kept track of using feature branches. When you start
working on an issue, rather than completing work on your own fork, you will
create a branch on the main repository.

This prevents the problem of work being lost if someone doesn't finish their
work on an issue. If work on an issue gets abandoned, someone else can pick up
from where it left off.

</Callout>

1. Look at the issues page on Github to find issuess that are currently open.

2. Check if someone else has already created a feature branch for the issue you
   want to work on by clicking on the dropdown on Github that says `production`
   and then clicking `View all branches`

   If the branch has not had activity for **five days** or more, you can start
   working on that branch, otherwise find another issue to work on.

## 3. Create a new branch

<Callout type="info">
  If you are working on a feature branch that already exists, you can skip this
  step and instead run `git checkout <feature-branch-name>` in the terminal
</Callout>

1. Switch to the development branch by running `git checkout development`

2. Ensure that your local repository is up to date by running `git pull`

3. Create a feature branch according to the following naming conventions by
   running `git branch <feature-branch-name>` (without brackets)

4. Switch to the newly created branch with `git checkout <feature-branch-name>`

### Branch naming conventions

Branches should be prefixed with their branch type. There are two main branch
types you will create:

1. Feature branches are used for developing new features. Use the prefix
   `feature/`. For example, `feature/3-login-system`
2. Bugfix branches are used to fix bugs in the code. Use the prefix `bugfix/`.
   For example, `bugfix/5-header-styling`.

In addition, to these prefixes, branch names must follow additional criteria:

- **Include the issue number:** If your branch is realted to an issue, include
  the issue number after the prefix. For example, `bugfix/12-map-crashing`
- **Lowercase and hyphen-separated:** Use only lowercase letters and hypens to
  separate words.
- **No continuous hyphens:** Do not use multiple hypens in a row.
  `feature/-new--login` can be hard to read

## 4. Create commits and push to the main repository

- While writing code, you should often create commits with `git add .` and
  `git commit -m <commit message>`

- Frequently push your new commits to the main repository so other people can
  see your work with `git push origin`. This ensures that other people won't
  work on your issue at the same time!

## 5. Create a pull request

Once you have finished working on the issue, start a pull request to merge your
branch into the development branch. One of the tech leads will approve your code
before it will be fully merged.

To issue a pull request:

1. On Github, navigate to the main page of the repository
2. In the "branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits

   <img
     src="/branch-dropdown.webp"
     alt="dropdown"
     style={{ maxHeight: "300px" }}
   />

3. Above the list of files, in the yellow banner, click Compare & pull request
   to create a pull request for the associated branch.

<img
  src="/pull-request-compare.webp"
  alt="dropdown"
  style={{ maxHeight: "300px" }}
/>

4. Type a title in and description for your pull request
5. **Ensure that the description contains text `Closes #<issue-number>` so the
   issue will be linked. For example `Closes #5`**
