# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

## Repository Structure

For this project, branches will be split up into three categories: production,
development, and features.

The **production** branch will hold code that has no errors and should always be
a working version of the app. This branch will be updated less frequently and
each commit will represent the equivalent of version updates of the app.

The **development** branch will be updated much more frequently. It holds all of
the new updates after each feature branch has been completed and merged.

The **feature** branches will each be created to represent work on one issue.
They should be focused on a specific issue, short-lived, and quickly merged back
into the development branch after work on the issue is completed.

## Cloning the Repository

First, navigate to our Github repository and find the green code button near the
top right. Click on it and copy the link that appears in the dropdown.

Next, in your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder/location you would
like your repository to be in.

Then clone your repository and enter the directory it creates:

```bash
$ git clone <paste your repository's address>
$ cd <the newly created directory>
```
