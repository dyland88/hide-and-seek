# Secrets

This project uses secret keys to protect sensitive information, such as API keys
or database passwords. Secret keys are like passwords that allow your
application to access certain resources or services. It is important to keep
these keys secret to prevent unauthorized access.

## Setting up your secrets

To get started, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
This file will contain all of your secret keys.

1.  Duplicate the `.env.example` file in the root of your project.
2.  Rename the duplicated file to `.env`.
3.  Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual
    secret keys.

:::note All keys must be prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`. This is required by Expo
to expose the variables to the client-side code. :::

:::danger Do not commit your `.env` file to your Git repository! This file
should only exist on your local machine. :::

## Adding new secrets

When adding new secret keys, make sure to follow these steps:

1.  Add the new key to your `.env` file.
2.  Prefix the key with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`.
3.  Add your new key, with its type in the @/lib/env.ts file using
    [zod](https://zod.dev/?id=table-of-contents)
4.  **Restart** your Expo development server to apply the changes.
5.  Use your key anywhere by importing @/lib/env.ts
